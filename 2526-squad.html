He's a big player that's wanted by many big teams such as Real Madrid but his loyalty stays here at North London </p><p>Gabriel our highest goal scoring cb right behind L. Koscielny definately a great defender very passionate and when he gets to his 30's definately will be a CB to recognize and with him and Saliba at the back I dont really see anyone scoring behind them </p><p>in our LB position its mostly a rotation of between Califiori <em>sorry if i misspelt</em> or MLS and both are very nimble in that position moving up to get an assist or if within range theyre not afraid to take a shot I also see them playing other positions like for MLS i could also see him playing in the midfield position while Califiouri becuase of his hieght i could also see him playing ST or winger </p><p>in substitutions we're still very solid with Mosquera as most likely the first CB to go in and seems like a very solid and very sorry to white zinchenk and evryone else Ive skipped </p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="true" data-translation="Add images"> </div></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://alexwhojohn.github.io/mywebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://alexwhojohn.github.io/mywebsite/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=700105c316933a8202041b6415abb233"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
