Ødegaard’s the guy who runs the show — he’s creative, calm on the ball, and always finding the perfect pass. Plus, he works hard off the ball too, chasing opponents and leading the team. It’s easy to see why he’s captain.</p><p data-start="996" data-end="1273">Then you’ve got Declan Rice, who’s a total powerhouse. He’s strong, fast, and really good at breaking up the other team’s play. He also helps push us forward, and you can tell he’s got that leadership vibe. When Rice is playing well, it feels like Arsenal are solid everywhere.</p><p data-start="1275" data-end="1533">This season, Martín Zubimendi joined us, and honestly, he’s been great. He’s calm, cool, and always makes smart decisions. When we need to keep the ball and control the game, he’s the guy we trust. Having him gives us more balance, which is really important.</p><p data-start="1535" data-end="1799">Kai Havertz is an interesting one. He’s got good size and skill, and sometimes he plays deeper in midfield. When he’s on form, he makes things exciting with his movement and runs into the box. It’s nice seeing him settle in and add something different to the team.</p><p data-start="1801" data-end="2029">Christian Nørgaard came in to add some experience and depth. He might not start every game, but when he’s on, he helps keep the midfield steady. It’s good to have a player like him to rely on, especially when others need a rest.</p><p data-start="2031" data-end="2300">Thomas Partey and Jorginho are also key pieces. Partey is great when fit — strong and good on the ball — but injuries have slowed him down. Jorginho brings calm and experience, usually coming on late to help close out games. Both add something important when they play.</p><p data-start="2302" data-end="2565">One exciting new addition is <span style="color: #02192b;"><strong>eze</strong></span> He’s quick, creative, and loves to take players on. Eze adds flair and unpredictability to the midfield, which can really unlock tough defences. It’s great to have someone with his skill and energy joining the squad.</p><p data-start="2567" data-end="2799">And then there’s Ethan Nwaneri — a super talented young kid who’s already getting some minutes. He’s got great skills and creativity, and it’s exciting to see him slowly breaking through. He’s definitely one to watch for the future.</p><p data-start="2801" data-end="2993">All in all, Arsenal’s midfield feels strong and balanced. With a mix of skill, experience, and youth, they’ve got what it takes to make a real impact this season. It’s exciting to watch</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://alexwhojohn.github.io/mywebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://alexwhojohn.github.io/mywebsite/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=700105c316933a8202041b6415abb233"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
